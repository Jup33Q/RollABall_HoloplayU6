# RollABall_HoloplayU6
## Description
this is my first unity holographic game (developed for LKG 16inch (legacy) ), the portrait versions is in oven.
## How to Play
the scene have 15 green cube(food) in total. You should eat upto 12 by moving ball (with w-a-s-d or up-down-left-right keys) and eat those.
## versions
### 0.1(16 inch version)
I have tested on LKG portrait already, basic functions work well, but some UI are not shown properly, but the game experience is quite the same, (so lkg go may work, but I dont have one). you may not see your score if using LKG portrait.
